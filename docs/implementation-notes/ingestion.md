## Notes for Developers (Friendly)
- CSV: require existing **Account name**; suggest an onboarding hint with a drop‑down of user’s accounts and a link to create one.
- OFX/QFX: auto‑create account on first sight; prefix with `OFX` in the name for clarity; mask account id in UI.
- Always show import **result summaries** and **downloadable error reports** for skipped rows—keeps users confident and unblocked.
